A good tone of voice is one that has a good level of energy to it and reflects confidence: 
the quality is clear, the volume is moderate, and the pitch has a nice vocal range to it.
Go slow and be forceful with each letter and number.
Silence is about injecting intentional pauses in your discussion.

#### 17. Make Your Emails Stand Out Using The Subject Line
- Write Their Name
- Summarize the Email’s Topic
- Write Down a Deadline
