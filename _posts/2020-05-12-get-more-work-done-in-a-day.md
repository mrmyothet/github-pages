#### Timing is everything if you are really serious about getting more done every day**
> “Generally, people are most productive in the morning.   
> The two hours after becoming fully awake are likely to be the best.”

#### Start your day with a full tank
> It pays to take time away from work every day by fully unplugging in the evenings,   
> and get a solid 8 or 9 hours of sleep.

#### Separate your “today” list from your “master” list
> Commit about 20 minutes to write down at most five things you want to achieve the next day.

#### Manage your energy, not your time
> Breaks your work into manageable tasks,     
> and force yourself to single task on purpose within specific times.   
> And plan breaks on purpose.

#### Build a “getting ready to work” routine
> Build a routine that tells your brain and body it’s time to work.

#### Break up your work hours and take breaks
> longer sessions of productive work, followed by short breaks of 15 minutes or so, sync with our own natural cycles.

#### Create a forced deadline
> having a limited amount of time actually does increase the speed of your work.   
> If you’re working on a tight deadline, great    
> If you’re not, think of ways to set one for yourself. Set timer if it helps.
